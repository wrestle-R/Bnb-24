### Project Abstract
The **Ettarra Coffee House** website is designed to enhance customer engagement by providing a comprehensive platform for visitors to explore the coffee house’s offerings, philosophy, and events. The website features a user-friendly interface built using React, allowing customers to seamlessly navigate between the menu, shop, and booking options. 

It also showcases the coffee house’s dedication to sustainability through an immersive **"Our Coffee Philosophy"** section, emphasizing the sourcing, roasting, and brewing processes. Additionally, the site includes a dynamic events page, highlighting activities such as live music, stand-up comedy, and karaoke nights.

To improve accessibility and interaction, a **chatbot feature** is integrated, offering real-time assistance to users. **Tailwind CSS** is used to ensure the site is responsive and visually appealing, with a consistent dark red (#290202) theme that reflects the brand’s identity. The project aims to provide a rich, interactive experience that connects customers with Ettarra Coffee House’s community-focused atmosphere, while offering tools for browsing products, booking tables, and exploring upcoming events.
